The Dashboard includes 4 important elements of the research we completed:
1) The Breakdown of Customer type - customer vs subscriber
2) Peak hours of bike-sharing in August 2019
3) Gender breakdown of people using NYC bike-sharing
4) Total number of rides provided in August 2019

## Summary
In summary, we believe that a bike-sharing business could be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. Kate and I used this service while we were in NYC last summer, and it made our experience visiting the city so great that we would like to introduce this experience to the residents and guests of Des Moines.
* Our finding show that both men and women were able to use the service successfully. It also indicates that there's definite room for growth with the female population.
* The peak bike-sharing hours were 8am and later in the day, and the higher number of regular subscribers vs customers indicates to us that residents are using this service to get to and from work.
* The high number of short trips that the NYC bikes were used for shows that there's a real opportunity to provide a convenient solution to residents and tourists in Des Moines.
